 # CSCI 2910 - Server Side Web Programming

    GitHub keeps track of your code while you build upon it.

    GitHub classroom link allows you to turn in assignments to the respective dropbox for the assignment.

    Repository is a root directory that hold coding projects and other things.

    The GitHub account created in class will be used for professional job interviews and resumes.

    GitHub is made for code, having people collaborate with you on your code, useful to test code before using it in industry, and other useful purposes.

    Git and GitHub are two distinct things. 

    GitHub is a cloud repository system, allows multiple people to access the same code.

## Version Control System (VCS) 
	A way to manage files and directories

	Track changes over time

	Recall previous versions

	Source control is a subset of VCS

## What is Git?
	Created by Linus Torvalds in April 2005

	Replaced BitKeeper to manage Linux Kernel changes

	Command line version control program

	All companies expect you to know how to use Git. Over 90% of companies use Git 	for version control.

	Git is a Distributed system, does not have the weakness of a single point of failure

	Uses checksums to ensure data integrity

	Cross-platform

	Open source and free


## Programming should be done incrementally

    Code should be an experiment, don’t be afraid to make changes to the code.

    Everyone that’s working on a GitHub project takes their own copy of the Baseline Code. The Original Baseline doesn’t get changed until it is approved.

## Branching
	Let’s you have a bunch of different features or ideas in progress at any given time, 
    some that are ready to go and some that are not.

	If ideas don’t work, delete the branch.

	If you have different versions of the same problem, then Branch.

## Main (Master)
	Main was first called master, and Dev used to be called Slave.

	Was changed to be less offensive

	It is the main starting branch, every repo has one.

	Do not make changes directly to the Main, instead branch off and work with a 
	Test area.

## Commits
	When you add, edit, or delete a file. You are making a commits, and adding them to your branch.

	keeps track of your progress as you work on a feature branch

	Creates a transparent history of your work that others can follow to understand 
	What you’ve done and why.

	Each commit has an associated commit message describing the commit.

	Write clear concise commit messages.

	Work in small segments

## Pull Request

	Initiates discussion about your commits

	Great for collaboration help

	Helps start code review and conversations about proposed changes before they’re merged into the main branch.

## Merge and Deploy
	Once pull request has been reviewed and branch passes tests, you can deploy your changes to verify them in production.

	If your branch causes issues you can roll back the branch by deploying the existing main branch into production.

	Preserves a record of the historical changes to your code.

	Searchable to find out why things have been done.

	Keywords help with making historical documents and the changes that occurred.


## *What I Have Learned So Far* ##
    GitHub is an implementation of Git

    Visual Studio is an IDE, Integrated Development Environment 

    How to create a GitHub account and connect to GitHub Classroom
    
    How to make and edit a Markdown file
    
    How the use of a VCS can help control the workflow of code,
    and help other collaborate on the code
    
 ### *What I'm Still Confused about* ###
    When do I branch? Is it everytime i make a change in a repo. 
      or can i make a change in an existing branch?
    
    When a pull request is created without making changes is the project manager of the repo still notified?
    
    How to use Git within VS to post to a repo, but I'm sure I'll figure it out once I start a project.
